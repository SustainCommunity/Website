            <p class="introduction__paragraph">
                Things happen in life, and you can't always give your career the love and care it deserves. We've all
                found an amazing conference or training course coming up just at the right time. There's bills to pay,
                and while you know that the amazing event you would love to go to is a solid investment in your future
                income, you just can't quite afford it right now.
            </p>


            <p class="introduction__paragraph">
                Sometimes people have spare tickets, and they are delighted to donate a
                conference ticket to
                somebody they know will get good use out of it. Sometimes they are "paying it forward", they're giving
                someone else a leg up financially, because someone gave them a leg up in the past. And sometimes they
                are doing it out of the goodness of their hearts.

            People in the development community are amazing. They are some of the

                    Yes, this is for real.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We aren't talking about a free holiday here. There will have to be some investment from both parties
                    for any attendance to be successful. Sometimes, only the ticket to the event is complimentary, which
                    means the attendee will need to fund travel and accommodation, and that's fine.
                </p>
                <p> Sometimes, covering the entrance fee is not enough, and someone actually needs a touch more help,
                    and that's fine too (we usually end up trying to get people as much (or little) help as they
                    require).
                </p>
                <p> Sustain is here to connect the people who need help with the people who are happy to help, but it's
                    not a free ride.
                </p>

                Wow, this is amazing, how can my organisation help?

            <div class="event__text event__block">
                <p>
                    This could not happen without the help and support of individuals and organisations, and if you're
                    thinking of
                    helping, or have contributed in the past, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How can you help?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you run an event, just donate one ticket to Sustain, and we promise to get it to a good home. If
                    you're a speaker, and you bought your ticket before you were accepted, then consider donating your
                    ticket. Sponsors of events often get more tickets than they need, and these can also be given to
                    someone
                    deserving.</p>

                <p>
                    If you're a company (or individual) and you feel incredibly generous, then you can help fund
                    someone's
                    travel or accommodation costs to an event. Travel and accommodation are generally the most expensive
                    part of any event attendance, and even if people live within a reasonable driving distance, hotel
                    costs
                    can be prohibitively high. Paying for someone's hotel can be an amazing way to help someone who
                    needs a
                    little leg up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, nobody would be where they are today without the aid of someone else, and paying forward
                    someone's generosity to you can only help make our communities stronger.
